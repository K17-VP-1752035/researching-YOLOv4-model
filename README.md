About YOLOv4
YOLOv4 is a series of speed improvements over YOLOv3 and is installed from a Darknet fork. The source code of YOLOv4 is here. The architecture of YOLOv4 has made the object detection problem more accessible to those who do not have strong computing resources. It is possible to train an object detection network with very high accuracy using YOLOv4 with only a 1080ti or 2080ti GPU. In the future, re-optimizing current networks to accommodate weak computing resources or creating high parallelism in servers must certainly be done to be able to put computer vision applications into practice.
